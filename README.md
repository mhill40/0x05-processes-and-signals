This is me finally getting git (ha) to work wel enough to do it on my own. Im SCRAMBLING to
get everything in.

The start was a rough patch getting my hands used to working so much again but now ive got
tings pretty well down into memory. then the whole fathers day thing shaking up my world.

I dont like drama or mixing work and home life or coming off as toxic so i just reply to
what other people are saying or doing usually.

Now that we're past the start and i have a tangiblel foundation being built up, 
we will rock the roof off of thish place. its gonna be awesome. Im just glad we were able 
to come to an understanding and talk this out. 

ive done the boot camp thing. ive done the udemy and youtube thing. This is just right. I 
just am not good at expressing or communicating what im trying to say in a way thats clear
and concise.

now that ive got this foundation, im starting to knock my assignments out.

look at this beautiful code that i had to find the error which showcases my medical issue.. like typing -x--5 insead of -x- see i did it again 9x9 ack. see what i mean. --x grr 0x05

anyway. ihope dvorak will solve everything. ive gone on long enough. Communication is paramount
and just know i cant always express or find words to show physically something i learned at 3 years old digitally kind of thing. besides pressing the up arrow. maybe a script that dumps the command history to a log file? that would be nice for someone to code.

anyway im almost done with things. im doing everything word for word.
